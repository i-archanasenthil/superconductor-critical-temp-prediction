**Unlocking Superconductor Potential:Predicting Critical Temperatures with Multivariate Regression**

This repository explores the prediction of critical temperatures of superconductors using multivariate regression. The model employs linear regression with log transformation to improve the prediction accuracy of critical temperatures based on various material properties. This project demonstrates how data transformation techniques can enhance the performance of regression models in scientific applications.

**Introduction**

Superconductors are materials that can conduct electricity without resistance when cooled below a certain temperature, known as the critical temperature (Tc). Accurately predicting the critical temperature of superconductors is essential for their practical applications. This project aims to develop a predictive model using R that can estimate the critical temperature based on material properties, incorporating a multivariate regression approach with log transformation.

**Methodology**

**Data Preprocessing**

The dataset contains various properties of superconducting materials, such as composition, pressure, and other characteristics. The preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalizing data, and selecting relevant features for the regression model.

**Log Transformation**

Since the relationship between the material properties and the critical temperature may be non-linear, a log transformation is applied to the target variable (Tc). This transformation helps stabilize variance and makes the model more reliable in predicting Tc over a wide range of values.

**Multivariate Linear Regression**

The primary technique used for prediction is multivariate linear regression, where multiple independent variables are used to predict the dependent variable (Tc). Linear regression helps model the linear relationships between the material properties and the critical temperature.

**Results**

The model successfully predicts the critical temperature based on various material properties. The log transformation helped improve the accuracy by stabilizing variance and allowing for more robust predictions. The evaluation metrics, such as R-squared and RMSE, indicate the model's effectiveness in predicting critical temperatures for superconducting materials.
